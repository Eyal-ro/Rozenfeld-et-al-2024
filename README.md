# Rozenfeld-et-al-2025
This repository contains the data and code used to generate the figures in the paper titled “Neuronal Circuit Mechanisms of Competitive Interaction Between Action-based and Coincidence Learning” by Rozenfeld et.al. All of the code was written in MATLAB.
The code was tested on a Windows 10 PC and does not require any specialized hardware.

## Installing and executing the code

* Download code and data files.
* Add the directory path to MATLAB.
* Run each script to generate the desired figure.


### Dependencies

* This package was generated using MATLAB R2018a on a Windows 10 machine. 
* Some scripts require the shadedErrorBar, UnivarScatter, Shapiro-Wilk and Shapiro-Francia normality tests, and Measures of Effect Size (MES) toolboxes.
